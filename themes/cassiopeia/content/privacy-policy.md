# Privacy Policy

Westminster Astronomical Society does not collect or store any personal data.

- No personal information is collected.
- No information is shared with, sent to or sold to third-parties.
- No cookies or tracking technologies are used.
- We do not use any third-party analytics services such as Google Analytics.
- Neither this website or our presence on various social media platforms is monetized.

## Information we collect and what we use it for

The server hosting this site can log the following information:

- IP address of the requesting user
- Date and time of the request
- Page URL
- HTTP Referrer
- Device type, browser and operating system

Logs are kept for security, traffic management, and performance monitoring. We
do not share this information with any third-parties and logs are periodically
deleted.

## Security

Although we do not collect any personal information, good citizenship dictates
that we take appropriate measures to prevent malicious actors from using our
system to attack others. This is a static site so there are no user accounts to
compromise and no database to attack. We have a fairly restrictive CSP (Content
Security Policy) in place to prevent XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks and
prevent loading of outside resources. HTTPS is enforced to encrypt data in
transit. 

The site has an A+ rating on the 
[HTTP Observatory Report](https://observatory.mozilla.org/).
