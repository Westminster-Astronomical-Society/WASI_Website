# What's Up, Basics

Membership meetings start with a 30-minute "What's Up, Basics" session where a presenter shares interesting things
to find in the sky that month. Since January, 2026 we've been including this information in our monthly WASI Update
mailing. Here's a collection of these presentations.

### 2026:
- [January](/whats-up/2026/january.pdf) - Skycharts, viewing the comets, telescopes, and a flat or sperhical Earth?
