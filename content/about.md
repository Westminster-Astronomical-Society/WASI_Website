## About Westminster Astronomical Society

Westminster Astronomical Society (WASI) is a community of amateur astronomers
based in Westminster, Maryland. We are dedicated to promoting the study of
astronomy and enjoyment of the night sky through regular meetings featuring
guest speakers, planetarium shows and presentations, public outreach, and public
observing events.

Founded in 1984, WASI has a long history of fostering a love for astronomy among
its members and the local community. Our members range from beginners to
experienced astronomers, and we welcome anyone with an interest in exploring the
wonders of the universe.

### Monthly Meetings

We hold [monthly meetings](/categories/member-meeting/) on the second Wednesday
of each month at the Bear Branch Nature Center in Westminster, where we host
guest speakers who share their knowledge and experience in astronomy and related
fields. Our meetings also include presentations on upcoming celestial events for
the month, and observing tips and techniques for both new and experienced
observers.

### Observing Opportunities

WASI hosts regular public observing events at Bear Branch Nature Center and
other locations throughout the year. These events provide an opportunity for
members and the public to observe celestial objects through telescopes and
binoculars, and to learn about the night sky from experienced amateur
astronomers. Check our [events
