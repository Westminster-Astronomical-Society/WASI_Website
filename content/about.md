## About Westminster Astronomical Society

Westminster Astronomical Society (WASI) is a community of amateur astronomers based in Westminster, Maryland. We are dedicated to promoting the study of astronomy and enjoyment of the night sky through regular meetings featuring guest speakers, planetarium shows and presentations, public outreach, and public observing events.

Founded in 1984, WASI has a long history of fostering a love for astronomy among its members and the local community. Our members range from beginners to experienced astronomers, and we welcome anyone with an interest in exploring the wonders of the universe.

### Monthly Meetings

We hold [monthly meetings](/categories/member-meeting/) on the second Wednesday of each month at the Bear Branch Nature Center in Westminster, where we host guest speakers who share their knowledge and experience in astronomy and related fields. Our meetings also include presentations on upcoming celestial events for the month, and observing tips and techniques for both new and experienced observers.

### Observing Opportunities

WASI hosts regular public observing events at Bear Branch Nature Center and other locations throughout the year. These events provide an opportunity for members and the public to observe celestial objects through telescopes and binoculars, and to learn about the night sky from experienced amateur astronomers. Check our [events calendar](https://nightsky.jpl.nasa.gov/events/wasi/) for upcoming observing opportunities.
