## Blaine F. Roelke Memorial Observatory

The Blaine F. Roelke Memorial Observatory is located at the Bear Branch Nature Center in 
Westminster, Maryland. It houses a 14-inch Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope that is used for 
public observing sessions, member observing nights, and special events.

One of the benefits of WASI membership is that members are allowed to use this instrument. From
time to time we conduct training, and once trained, you're welcome to run the observatory
and telescope. Members often attach a camera - or, run it visually using our eyepieces. ADD SOMETHING
ABOUT THE SOP HERE.
