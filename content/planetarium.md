## Bear Branch Nature Center Planetarium

Bear Branch Nature Center has exciting opportunities for amateur astronomers of all levels.

A 29-seat planetarium allows visitors to tour the stars. Renovated in 2013 and again in 2024, 
the planetarium is now fully-digital, offering audiences a chance to participate in guided 
tours of the night sky, visit the planets of our Solar System, and to view exciting 
feature movies about the heavens.
