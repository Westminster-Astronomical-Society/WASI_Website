# Astronomy Outreach

Westminster Astronomical Society is committed to public outreach and education in astronomy. We organize public star parties, public lectures, and community events to engage the community and inspire interest in astronomy and space science. To request a public outreach event for your organization, please contact the outreach coordinator at [outreach@westminsterastro.org](mailto:outreach@westminsterastro.org) or fill out the request form at the Night Sky Network.
