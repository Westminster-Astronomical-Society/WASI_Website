In this role, Al works closely with our county partners at Bear Branch to schedule monthly shows, maintain the equipment, and find exciting content for the shows. He is married to your treasurer, and can be found at several of the public outreach events held each
year by both WASI and the Tri State Astronomy clubs (which happens to meet in the Hagerstown planetarium). His introduction to the night sky was while learning celestial navigation, and he maintains a keen interest in navigation principles and techniques through the ages, from the time of the Hindu explorers, the Phoenicians, the Romans, the Vikings, and the Europeans, with a favorite being the Polynesian wayfinders.
