## WASI Monthly Members Meeting

Monthly members meetings are held at 7:00 PM EST on the second Wednesday of the
month at the Bear Branch Nature Center, 300 John Owings Rd. Westminster, MD and
online via Zoom. The "What's Up Basics!" presentation is at 7:00 PM EST,
followed by the featured guest speaker presentation at 7:30 PM EST. Club updates
and business meeting will follow.

Our November 12 meeting will be our annual “show and tell” buyer’s workshop of our astronomy equipment. This is a chance to learn about each other’s gear. Thinking about Christmas gifts? You may find someone is using just the goody you want… or get a warning that the latest shiny thing doesn’t really fulfill the vendor’s promises.

To keep the meeting from running way too long, presenters are limited to 5-7 minutes and must RSVP to secretary@westminsterastro.org in advance to get on the agenda.

You are also welcome to bring items to trade, swap, or sell during the set up and break times.
