There will be an almanac here eventually. It will contain Sun and Moon data, planets, weather, and other useful information for the observatory at Bear Branch Nature Center.

Here are some links to outside resources that might be useful:

- [USNO Data Services:](https://aa.usno.navy.mil/data/index) Sun and Moon data, rise/set/twilight and more.
- [JPL Solar System Dynamics:](https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/) Ephemerides for solar system bodies.

- [TimeAndDate.com:](https://www.timeanddate.com/) Sun & Moon information, eclipses, and more.

You can find more information on the [Observing Resources](/observer-resources/) page.
